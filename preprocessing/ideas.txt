	- While drawing a grid, I noticed that it is difficult to estimate how many squares in my grid paper I had already passed.
	I think this is an interesting computational task. It requires quick counting as well as coordination to draw
	a straight line. If you varied the parameters of the line drawing...
		-> pen vs paper contrast
		-> size of grid
		-> length of line
	and measured certain characteristics of the line drawing
		-> the length of the line (by grid ticks) the person actually drew vs. the length they were supposed to draw
		-> how quickly they drew the line
		-> how straight the line is
	then you might be able to fit a model to it. This could reveal underlying computational frameworks related to perception.
	It could be related to the Bayesian model I wrote about in "Dude, where's my perception?"
	
	- Artificial intelligence based ASCII art generator. System that takes a photo as input and outputs ASCII art. Train with
	photos with white background. Just simple shapes that you can create the ASCII art for. Or use a dataset gathered from
	ASCII art gathered around the internet.

	- Have a neural net learn a bunch of functions, then use that set of functions to approximate new functions.
		- If you had neural networks representing sin functions of many frequencies, would it be possible to reveal a fourier
		transform underlying a neural network representing an arbitrary function by using the weights/parameters of the 
		sinusoidal networks as components that could be summed to represent the arbitrary function?

	- Perhaps the reason people are able to learn from such few examples is that the brain has a circuit for data augmentation.
