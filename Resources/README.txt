This folder contains some useful resources (inasfar as it is quicker not to generate them each time) useful to the preprocessing pipeline

-   combo_dict: maps abstract combinations to one hot representation
-   hold_dict: maps one hot representation to whether that note is held, released, or neither (nan)
-   modifier_dict: maps one hot representation to regular, forced, or tap notes
-   note_dict: seems to be the same thing as combo_dict
