    "## Creating the function that converts notes arrays from a higher difficulty to a lower one\n",

    "The function will take two inputs:\n",
    "-  An expert notes array\n",
    "-  A transition probability matrix, $M$\n",
    "\n",
    "Ultimately we will map the expert notes array to the lower difficulty by randomly sampling a note from the row in the transition probability matrix corresponding to the note present in the expert notes array.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, in a simplified 3-note world, the expert notes array might look like this:\n",

    "\\begin{bmatrix}\n",
    "0 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 3 & 0 & 0 & 0\n",
    "\\end{bmatrix}\n",
    "\n",

    "0.2 & 0.1 & 0.1 & 0.6 \\\\\n",

    "P_{i,0} & P_{i,1} & P_{i,2} & P_{i,3}\n",
    "\\end{bmatrix}\n",
    "\n",
    "So the first note in the notes array is a $1$, we would randomly sample from the first row in the transition matrix to determine what the one is translated to.\n",
