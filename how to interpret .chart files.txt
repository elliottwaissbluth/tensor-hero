N = Note
S = Starpower phrase

2nd number = Type of note:

	(0-4 = Green-Orange, 
	 5 is a force flag, 
	 6 is the tap note flag, 
	 7 is an open note)

3rd number - Note length

[tick] = [note type] [note description] [sustain length]
       = [ N or S  ] [0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7 ] [ (in ticks)   ]	

When a file is read, notes that are sufficiently close to each other are automatically registered as hammer ons. This is
why there's a force flag but not hammer-on flag.

Let's look at this example .chart file:

[Song]
{
  Name = "My Song 1"
  Artist = "Elliott Waissbluth"
  Offset = 0
  Resolution = 192	# Resolution is basically always 192. This is how many ticks there are per bar
  Player2 = bass
  Difficulty = 0
  PreviewStart = 0
  PreviewEnd = 0
  Genre = "rock"
  MediaType = "cd"
}
[SyncTrack]
{
  0 = TS 4		# TS = Time signature, 4 means 4/4 time signature
  0 = B 120000		# B = BPM, in this case it is 120
}				# 0 on the left side means at time 0, more lines will indicate changing TS and B throughout 
[Events]			# the song
{
}
[ExpertSingle]		# The following chart has 6 green notes, one every 1/8 bar
{
  96 = N 0 0
  192 = N 0 0
  288 = N 0 0
  384 = N 0 0
  480 = N 0 0
  576 = N 0 0
}
